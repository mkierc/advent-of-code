# Advent of Code 2015

Learning Python 3 by doing challenges from the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2015)

---

Santa was hoping for a white Christmas, but his weather machine's "snow" function is powered by
stars, and he's fresh out! To save Christmas, he needs you to collect **fifty stars**
by December 25th.

Collect stars by helping Santa solve puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in
the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants
**one star**. Good luck!
