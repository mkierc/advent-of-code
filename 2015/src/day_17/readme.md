## Day 17 - No Such Thing as Too Much

### Part One

The elves bought too much eggnog again - `150` liters this time. To fit it all into your
refrigerator, you'll need to move it into smaller containers. You take an inventory of
the capacities of the available containers.

For example, suppose you have containers of size `20`, `15`, `10`, `5`, and `5` liters. If you need
to store `25` liters, there are four ways to do it:

 * `15` and `10`
 * `20` and `5` (the first `5`)
 * `20` and `5` (the second `5`)
 * `15`, `5`, and `5`

Filling all containers entirely, how many different **combinations of containers** can exactly fit
all `150` liters of eggnog?
