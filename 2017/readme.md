# Advent of Code 2017

Learning Python 3 by doing challenges from the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2017)

---

The night before Christmas, one of Santa's Elves calls you in a panic. "The printer's broken!
We can't print the **Naughty or Nice List**!" By the time you make it to sub-basement 17, there are
only a few minutes until midnight. "We have a big problem," she says; "there must be almost **fifty**
bugs in this system, but nothing else can print The List. Stand in this square, quick! There's
no time to explain; if you can convince them to pay you in **stars**, you'll be able to--"
She pulls a lever and the world goes blurry.

When your eyes can focus again, everything seems a lot more pixelated than before. She must have
sent you inside the computer! You check the system clock: **25 milliseconds** until midnight.
With that much time, you should be able to collect all **fifty stars** by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each ~~day~~ millisecond in
the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.
Each puzzle grants **one star**. Good luck!
