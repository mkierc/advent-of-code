# Advent of Code 2016

Learning Python 3 by doing challenges from the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2016) 

---

Santa's sleigh uses a very high-precision clock to guide its movements,
and the clock's oscillator is regulated by stars. Unfortunately, the
stars have been stolen... by the Easter Bunny. To save Christmas,
Santa needs you to retrieve all **fifty stars** by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available
on each day in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked
when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants **one star**. Good luck!
